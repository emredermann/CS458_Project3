### 1. With the help of Test Driven Development (TDD)
Develop a responsive page (that can run on laptops, mobile devices etc., no mobile native code required) for the following tasks:
#### a) You enter your coordinates of your location and it shows your country (via Google Map API etc.).
#### b) It gets GPS coordinates of your device automatically and it shows your distance to the Geographic North Pole (Terrestrial North Pole).
#### c) You enter your coordinates or it gets GPS of your device, then it shows your distance to the Moonâ€™s core (You should also take the changing position of Moon into account).
#### d) For each one (a,b, and c parts) write all the test cases.
#### e) Write test code (red-line) and write the main code to pass just the red-line.
#### f) Attach your code and UML diagrams (Activity, State, Use-case, Sequence, and Class)
### 2. Refactor your code and explain what you have done.
### 3. Evaluate your TDD experience in terms of development velocity and code quality.
